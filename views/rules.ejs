                <ol align="left" style="line-height: 95%; color: lightgray;opacity: 0.95;">
                <li>All of the rules mentioned below are subject to change (wherever applicable) without prior notice. By signing up for graVITas premier league 1.0, you agree to follow all undermentioned regulations.</li><br />
                <li> In the event of any disputes, the organizer’s decision shall hold.</li><br />
                <li>At the beginning of the event, each participant / team will have to create a squad of exactly 16 cricket players with the following specifications: at least 5 batsmen, at least 5 bowlers, at least one all-rounder, and one team coach. The player categories will be explicitly mentioned during squad formation. The appropriate amount will be deducted from the participant’s / team’s graVITas premier league auction purse. The surplus amount, if any will have no bearing whatsoever on future transactions, wherever applicable.
                <br />Note: The purchase limit is virtual USD 10 million. All the individual player prices are scaled accordingly.</li><br />
                <li>Before each match starts, participants / teams can customize their teams to form the final playing eleven with the following restriction-this playing eleven should have exactly one all-rounder. Participants / teams can also assign batting orders in order to facilitate squad rotation.</li><br />
                <li>Participants shall be notified of their next match well in advance. At specified times, the game engine will simulate the match, following which the participants will be able to see ball by ball commentary and advanced statistical analytics.</li><br />
                <li>Initially, each participant’s squad will play 7 matches with random opponent squads such that no two teams play each other more than once. After this league stage has concluded, the top 8 teams will be shortlisted for the next round, where a similar process will be repeated. In the end, the 8 remaining finalists will participate in an actual player auction.</li><br />
                <li>As an extension to clause 7,  should there be any clash in terms of rankings between multiple teams due to points, then the priority of ascension will be decided by the net run rate, which is calculated as follows: (runs scored/overs batted)-(runs conceded/overs bowled)</li><br />
                <li>Following the auction for the last 8 participants, an actual league will commence. The top three teams will be decided by the eliminator method used in the Indian Premier league.</li><br />
                <li>Scoring: Each victory earns the winning team 2 points, whereas the losing team gets 0 points. A match shall be declared a tie, if all of the following conditions hold simultaneously:
                    <ol style="line-height: 95%;color: lightgray;opacity:0.95;"><li style="list-style-type: lower-roman"> The number of runs scored by both teams is exactly the same.</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: lower-roman">The number of wickets lost by both teams is exactly the same. If this does not hold, then the team that has lost fewer wickets shall be declared victorious.</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: lower-roman">If the number of wickets lost is equal, then the team with a higher run rate shall be declared victorious. In the highly unlikely event of the run rates being equal, the match shall be declared a TIE, and both teams shall be awarded one point apiece.</li></ol>
                </li>
                </ol>
